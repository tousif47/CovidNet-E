# R-NET
Here you will find the user-end version of my [Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Network](https://github.com/tousif47/Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Networks) project. A GUI interface is being developed, where you can upload your own X-Ray images and the software will predict if you are infected with Covid19, Pneumonia or if you are healthy. You can check the report [here](https://github.com/tousif47/Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Networks/blob/master/docs/report.pdf).


# UPDATE: The repo is being updated privately. The GUI app R-NET is on field trial by Fauji Foundation in various hospitals at Pakistan. You can also take part in the trial from your Computer by following the steps below:
- Install latest version of Python and PIP
- Download the R-NET.bat script from this repo
- Double click it from a folder, where the models will be saved. So make sure you have at least 3GB of empty space on that drive!
- Launch the app from the command prompt by:
```
covid19-detector
```
- At the first launch, it will automatically prompt you for locating the folders containing the trained models. If it doesn't, then click the settings icon on the bar "model". And select the folder where the trained models is located.

# NOTE: This is still a prototype, expect bugs to happen. Any bugs you found, please post it in the issues section. We are not working behind this full-time but we will check and try to solve it often. To run the GUI correctly you will need to have your resolution set at 1920x1080. When you are uploading
