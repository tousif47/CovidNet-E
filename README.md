# R-NET
Here you will find the user-end version of my [Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Network](https://github.com/tousif47/Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Networks) project. A GUI interface is being developed, where you can upload your own X-Ray images and the software will predict if you are infected with Covid19, Pneumonia or if you are healthy.

Details Cooming Soon! Meanwhile you can check the report of the original project [here](https://github.com/tousif47/Covid19-detection-by-Neural-Networks/blob/master/docs/report.pdf).
